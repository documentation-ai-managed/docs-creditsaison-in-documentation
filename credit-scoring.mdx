## Risk Assessment Levels

Credit scores are categorized into risk levels to guide lending decisions.

| Score Range | Risk Level | Approval Rate | Interest Rate Range |
|-------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 800-900 | Excellent | 95% | 8-12% |
| 700-799 | Good | 85% | 12-16% |
| 600-699 | Fair | 65% | 16-20% |
| 500-599 | Poor | 35% | 20-25% |
| 300-499 | Very Poor | 10% | 25%+ |

## Scoring API Usage

Integrate credit scoring into your applications using our REST API.

<Request tabs="curl,python" show-lines="true">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.creditsaison.in/v1/credit-score \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "borrowerId": "BR001",
      "modelType": "personal_loan",
      "data": {
        "income": 750000,
        "existingLoans": 1,
        "creditHistory": "good"
      }
    }'
  ```
  ```python
